## My website

Heyo!

Thanks for checking out my website and/or GitHub. This website was made using React which means that code wise it is slighly more interesting than a plain old HTML and CSS website. I also opted to use SCSS and minify the CSS as I prefer the formatting options of SCSS as it reminds me of class structures. If you have any questions about anything I did in my website or anything in general, feel free to contact me (my contact information is on my website).
