## My website

Thanks for checking out my website! This is at least the third public iteration of it and it has gone through many private versions too that never made the cut to be published. This version uses bootstrap and some of their examples to make what I view as the best version so far. The first version was just a straight copy paste of a public template as I did not want to have to learn any CSS as I found it troublesome to work with. The most recent prior version used ReactJS as I wanted to get some experience using it and seeing the capabilities that come with it. It turns out that it was more powerful than I needed and made it more complicated to work on, which is why I made the choice to go back to regular HTML, CSS and JS. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
